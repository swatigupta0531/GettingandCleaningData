======================

Swati Gupta

As required, run_analysis.r script should be created which will do the following. 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Steps to work on this course project
A. Download the data source from the coursera.
B. Create a working directory in your system and then put datasets into that directory.
C. As expected, create run_analysis.r and copy it into the working directory.
D. In the end, run source("run_analysis.R") which will generate tidy_data.txt.
